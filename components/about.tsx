        After earning my Bachelor's degree within the study program "Software
        and Data Engineering", I decided to persue my passion for programming. I
        enrolled in a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp in ZÃ¼rich. I always
        strive for improving my coding skills and to learn new technologies.

        In my free time I like hiking, cooking, playing video games and going
        out with friends.
